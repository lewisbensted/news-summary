Then there’s the Japanese defender <strong>Takehiro Tomiyasu</strong>, who has been linked with both Spurs and Leicester, with news that his current employers, Bologna, are showing interest in the Argentinian defender Andres Herrera suggesting they might be preparing to lose the 22-year-old. He wouldn’t be the first defender Spurs have tried to sign this summer – Marca reports that Villarreal’s Pau Torres turned them down because he wants to play in the Champions League.</p> <p>That’s not all that Marca is reporting: on its front page it trumpets news that <strong>Real Madrid</strong>’s pursuit of <strong>Kylian Mbappé </strong>has “entered its decisive phase this week”, though inside the tune changes slightly, with the assertion that “we are entering the decisive two weeks”. Either way, this is part of the decisive timeframe. The Spaniards are ready to make an offer but, with the player in the final year of his contract and pressure building in Paris for him to extend, they are “waiting for the tension between Mbappé and PSG to reach a peak before they make their move”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/marca/status/1427148116038496258\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaPortada?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LaPortada</a>🗞 &#39;Recta final&#39; 🐢 <a href=\"https://t.co/Oxt29Ro9f9\">https://t.co/Oxt29Ro9f9</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FelizLunes?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FelizLunes</a></p>&mdash; MARCA (@marca) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marca/status/1427148116038496258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 16, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>“We need to find quality,” said Sean Dyche after <strong>Burnley </strong>lost at home against Brighton on the season’s opening weekend, though he added that “nothing is imminent” despite rumours linking them to <strong>Maxwel Cornet</strong>, among others.

The Mail points out that Burnley’s last senior signing from a foreign club was Steve Defour from Anderlecht in 2016.</p> <p>The Times also reports that three Premier League clubs are squabbling over <strong>Divock Origi</strong>, with <strong>Wolves</strong>, <strong>West Ham</strong> and <strong>Crystal Palace</strong> all interested in the Belgian, who joined Liverpool when he was 19, is now 26, has started 63 games for the club in all competitions at the rate of nine a year (though he has been out on loan for some of them), and has very little to show for all those years except quite a lot of medals.

And <strong>Manchester City </strong>have taken an unexpected interest in the Solihull Moors striker <strong>Kyle Hudlin</strong>, who could not be less of an obvious fit for Pep Guardiola’s team of nimble, diminutive forwards – the 21-year-old is 6ft 9in, and also on the radar of Middlesbrough and Cardiff.</p>"

The France forward is entering the final year of his contract and Kroos reportedly “wouldn’t be surprised” if he pitched up at the Bernabéu this summer, despite Real – like Barcelona – being totally hobbled by financial restraints that are absolutely nothing to do with them and everything to do with the rest of football for merely existing.</p> <p>A more plausible Manchester United-related slice of tittle-tattle might be the departure of <strong>Anthony Martial</strong> to <strong>Internazionale</strong> for £50m as the Italian champions seek to fill the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/09/romelu-lukaku-starts-chelsea-medical-after-115m-fee-agreed-with-inter\">impending Romelu Lukaku-shaped hole</a> in their attack.

L’Equipe reports the French club have made a bid for the Switzerland playmaker that, although only thought to be around €5m-€7m, would also cost Lyon a fair old wedge in wages.

The findings brought to the fore the issue of brain injury in the sport but authorities frequently insisted more research was necessary before a link with heading could be confirmed. Stewart says that connection can now be shown and called for authorities to act.</p> <p>“With the current data we’re now at the point to suggest that football should be sold with a health warning saying repeated heading in football may lead to an increased risk of dementia,” he said. “That’s where we are now, that cannot be ignored.</p> <p>“In the previous study we didn’t have sufficient data to be able to look at the important factor: exposure to football. What we could say last time was that being a footballer meant your risk of dying with a degenerative brain disease was higher, but we couldn’t say what in football was doing it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/commentisfree/2020/dec/09/football-without-headers-is-unthinkable-or-is-it\">Football without headers is unthinkable – or is it? | Adrian Chiles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Now, through using our surrogates for exposure to heading and brain injury, which are field position and length of playing the game, we can see that if you’re in a position where you’re exposed to a high level of head impacts or you play the game longer, your risk is higher.”</p> <p>The new research, published in the journal JAMA Neurology, finds that risk of neurodegenerative disease in former professional footballers varies by player position and career length, but not by playing era. Whereas goalkeepers, who rarely head the ball, have a risk statistically indistinguishable from that of a control group, defenders – who head the ball the most – have a five-fold risk of developing neurodegenerative disease. That risk increases the longer a player’s career goes on and the risk did not change across the 7,676 players the study analysed, despite their dates of birth ranging from 1900 to 1976.</p> <p>“The data from this paper is the missing link in trying to understand this connection between sport and dementia,” Stewart said. “We put that together with what we know about the mortality risk … and there really isn’t anything else. There is no other proposed risk factor and this is one we could really address and eliminate this disease.</p> <p>“I think football has to ask the difficult questions: is heading absolutely necessary to the game of football? Is potential exposure to degenerative brain disease absolutely necessary? Or can some other form of the game be considered?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Field study is funded by the Football Association and the Professional Footballers’ Association but Stewart was critical of the measures the professional game has undertaken to limit the risk from heading.

The rules were implemented as a precautionary measure, but Stewart criticised them, saying they were “not based in science” and arguing no category of header created less risk.</p> <p>“If we think that heading in professional football is necessary and the risk of dementia is necessary then perhaps what football should be doing rather than considering concussion substitute protocols that don’t really stand up or limitations on heading in training which have no basis in science, they should be thinking about what football would look like without heading,” he said. “Let’s try that.”</p>"

Another Madridista, <strong>Marco Asensio</strong>, is also being touted as a potential target for Mikel Arteta and his sidekick Edu.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United</strong> remain keen to sign another midfielder before the transfer window <em>slams shut</em> at the end of the month and a name that has reportedly appeared on their radar is the Monaco youngster <strong>Aurélien Tchouaméni. </strong>The 21-year-old defensive midfielder established himself in Ligue 1 last season and also impressed at the Under-21 European Championship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2021/jun/07/mens-transfer-window-summer-2021-all-deals-from-europes-top-five-leagues\">Men’s transfer window summer 2021 – all deals from Europe’s top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 18-year-old <strong>Eduardo Camavinga</strong>, of Rennes, is another name that keeps cropping up and slightly bizarrely, some are saying <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CSTwj9GLKGN/\">this Instagram photo</a> of his Rennes kit hanging in the changing room amounts to a cryptic goodbye.

          "body": "<p><strong>“Former Liverpool manager Rafa Benítez’s appointment at Everton was surprising. Is there a more jaw-dropping example of a manager crossing an acrimonious derby divide (perhaps even directly)?”</strong> asks George Jones.</p> <p>Andy Grace is a Southampton fan who never forgets. “Benítez, once of Liverpool now Everton? Not even close. Derbies don’t come any more acrimonious than the one on the south coast. Harry Redknapp going <em>directly</em> from Portsmouth to Southampton and back to (his spiritual home) Portsmouth surely takes some beating.”</p> <p>Chris Richardson puts the spotlight on the West Midlands. “Ron Saunders took Aston Villa to their first (and most recent) top-flight title in 71 years during the 1980-81 season. Having steered Villa to the quarter-finals of the European Cup the following year, he resigned over a contract dispute and relocated 3.5 miles to arch-rivals Birmingham City (also then in Division One). Birmingham’s first home fixture after Saunders’ arrival was a 1-0 loss to Villa during which much of the opposition fans’ singing (to the tune of Bread of Heaven) was ‘Ron Saunders, Ron Saunders, you must be [eff]ing mad’. Perhaps this was warranted because Saunders’ assistant Tony Barton won the European Cup with the Villa team Saunders created, while Birmingham were promptly relegated. Birmingham gained promotion the next season but he ditched them for ever-so-slightly-less arch-rivals West Brom, who were also immediately relegated.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9016f461a2c8d0102c05eb62e5777c78685c7f1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9016f461a2c8d0102c05eb62e5777c78685c7f1b/0_0_4524_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ron Saunders questions the referee during Birmingham’s match against West Ham 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ron Saunders questions the referee during Birmingham’s match against West Ham 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The north London Derby can provide us with a couple of examples of derby divide-crossing managers. “A good one is Arsenal stalwart Terry Neill,” writes Mitchell Sandler. “Having left Highbury in 1970 to become player-manager at Hull, he impressed enough to become the successor to Bill Nicholson at Spurs in 1974. Perhaps inevitably, following Bertie Mee’s retirement two years later, he was top of a very short list when the Arsenal board looked for a replacement and he jumped at the chance to take the Gunners job.” Meanwhile, Ed Mortimer offers up George Graham. “A former player and manager of Arsenal, he took over at Tottenham [via Leeds]. Apparently Spurs even won some silverware, though it’s a technicality as trophies won with a Gooner in charge clearly can’t be counted.” Oh behave, Ed.</p> <p>Radomir Antić managed Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid and Barcelona but never moved directly between those clubs and Ernest Mangnall, the owner of a glorious moustache, crossed the Manchester derby divide in 1912. He began a 12-year stint at City having spent nine years at United, where he won two league titles and an FA Cup. He won nothing at City.</p> <h2>Qualifying to play for numerous national teams</h2> <p><strong>“Which player (active or retired) has been eligible to play for the highest number of different national teams?”</strong> asks Ben Janeson.<strong> “And other than Alfredo Di Stéfano, have any players played for three different national teams (not counting cases such as USSR/Russia or Yugoslavia/Serbia etc)?”</strong></p> <p>Let’s start with the first part. “Adnan Januzaj was qualified to play for six different national teams (Belgium, Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Turkey and Croatia), but not England, despite what was said at the time,” offers Jerry Higgins, setting the bar so high that it might take an extraordinary person to beat it.</p> <p>“Born on a refugee raft, Rio Mavuba was eligible for all of them,” writes Steve Hyde, with perfect timing. Mavuba was born in international waters off the coast of west Africa while fleeing the Angola civil war en route to France, where he settled and earned 13 caps for <em>Les Bleus</em> after turning down the chance to play for DR Congo. And while it might be true that Mavuba could have, theoretically, represented any nation, Fifa’s eligibility rules say a stateless person must have lived in the country they hope to represent for at least five years and demonstrate that the move to the territory of the association was not for the purpose of participating for its representative teams. So, in practical terms, a stateless person is not eligible for any nation until they have settled somewhere for a length of time.”</p> <p>As for the second element, Milton offers up a near-miss in Daniel Alberto Brailovsky, who played for Uruguay Under-20s, unofficial matches for Argentina and then 18 times for Israel, scoring three goals. But David Walker has another big-name striker to match Di Stéfano: “László Kubala, the famous Barcelona centre-forward, played for Czechoslovakia, his native Hungary and Spain. Like Stéfano, despite playing for three different countries he never appeared in the final stages of either a World Cup or European Championship. Both players were included in Spain’s squad for the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile, but, owing to injury, neither appeared in a match.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"495151549621e0b72b5e6216e09579aed9b5ab40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/495151549621e0b72b5e6216e09579aed9b5ab40/0_0_1547_1148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"László Kubala played for Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">László Kubala played for Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Winning big with a nation you never played club football in</h2> <p><strong>“Despite winning Euro 2020 with Italy Marco Verratti has never played a Serie A game. Has anyone else won major international tournament with their national team despite never having played a top flight game in that country?”</strong> asks Dan Almond.</p> <p>“That happened the day before with a player of lesser stature than Verratti,” writes Thomas Wendt, clearly building up to something. “A little known player called Lionel Messi won the Copa América, despite never playing a club match in Argentina. In the same squad, there was also Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martínez, who has never played a top-flight match in Argentina, having been signed by Arsenal as a youth player.</p> <p>“Paul Pogba has never played a game in France yet won the World Cup with them. He was signed by Manchester United from Le Havre as a youth-team player. And Antoine Griezmann shared the same glory despite having never played a senior game in France. He was signed by Real Sociedad (from Macon in the French sixth division) as a 14-year-old.”</p> <h2><strong>Knowledge archive</strong></h2> <p><strong>“I’ve been wondering for a while what I should call any prospective son to give him the best chance of success at professional football,”</strong> wrote Nick Pepper, in August 2010. <strong>“So my question is what is the most successful first name and surname in football in terms of trophies and titles won?”</strong></p> <p>“Although I’m inclined to say that, of Englishmen at least, Robert – shortened to Bob (by) – must top the bill (having provided World Cup success with Charlton and Moore, and exceptional managerial achievements for Paisley and Robson), I’ve no evidence of that,” wrote Robert D Marriott. “The most successful English player in terms of trophies won was Phil Neal, who collected four European Cups, one Uefa Cup, eight league titles, four League Cups, one European Super Cup, five Charity Shields, and one, er, Sherpa Van Trophy [while managing Bolton]. And no end of runners-up medals. What’s more, his surname can be used too, so I’d expect a Phillip George Neal Pepper to be playing for England in about 20 years’ time.”</p> <h2><strong>Can you help?</strong></h2> <p>“We all know of footballers who played cricket, but did any ever compete at the Olympics?” asks Harvey Mayne, presumably meaning in other sports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BenJaneson/status/1417423352701112325\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Goalkeeper Ronnie Hellström was capped 77 times for Sweden, but didn&#39;t win a single trophy over his 18-year career.<br>Striker Andrzej Szarmach played 11 WC matches for Poland, but didn&#39;t win a single trophy over his 20-year career.<br>Have any other top players been as unsuccessful?</p>&mdash; Ben Janeson (@BenJaneson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenJaneson/status/1417423352701112325?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 20, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>“With Rogelio Funes Mori making his debut for Mexico this week, does this make him and his brother Ramiro the first identical twins to play for different national teams?” wonders Logan Casey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sirsidneyp/status/1416445527730831361\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheKnowledge_GU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TheKnowledge_GU</a> As it&#39;s that time of the calendar when &#39;A Trialist&#39; makes his regular pre-season appearances, i wondered if (or how) other nations present this curiosity!? 😋</p>&mdash; Sir Sidney P (@sirsidneyp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sirsidneyp/status/1416445527730831361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 17, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JerryHiggins86/status/1417428463288569873\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wales are currently ranked 17th in the FIFA Rankings.

This was July 1916 and in the far-away Somme, the very men whom NBRC had been supplying with wellington boots were suffering catastrophic losses.</p> <p>This is the compelling tension underscoring Sweet FA, the story of the workplace women’s football teams who enjoyed enormous popularity during the first world war.</p> <p>It’s a bittersweet tale. On the one hand, the conflict gave the women unparalleled opportunities at work and play; on the other, it robbed them of brothers, sons and husbands. That the women’s game would be curtailed by a postwar ban lasting 50 years only adds to the injustice.</p> <p>And where better to tell this tale than on a stage perched on Tynecastle’s main stand, with the empty stadium as its backdrop? Performed by a tremendous nine-strong ensemble, the play by Paul Beeson and Tim Barrow draws on the popular theatre tradition laid down by 7:84 and Wildcat to blend community history and original songs by Matthew Brown in a lively, polemical show.</p> <p>There is a lot of history to distil – what with suffragettes, the 1918 flu pandemic and the machinations of the football authorities – and the play could do with a little less of it, but Bruce Strachan’s production is sharp, funny and well-drilled.</p> <p>From Rachel Millar’s Alice, with her sights on Preston’s unbeatable Dick, <a href=\"https://www.dickkerrladies.com/\">Kerr Ladies</a>, to Heather Cochrane’s Helen, with her hidden coaching skills, the cast have the coordination and sparkle of Premier League champions.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sweet FA is at <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sweet-f-a\">Tynecastle Park, Edinburgh</a>, until 30 August.</p></li> </ul>"

Kerr is a familiar face to most players in the Team GB squad but who that familiarity favours remains to be seen.

In Fridolina Rolfö, Stina Blackstenius, Kosovare Asllani and Sofia Jakobsson they boast a potent front line but the defence is just as formidable with Chelsea duo Magda Eriksson and Jonna Andersson and Bayern Munich’s impressive Hanna Glas conceding just twice. </p> <p>In Japan they face a team that has struggled to score but which has also conceded just two goals. Manager Asako Takakura took a young team to the World Cup in France two years ago to help prepare for the home Games and while there has been moments in matches where the technical, possession-heavy football so characteristic of the team has shone through, they have been fleeting. Takakura’s decision to leave out the new Arsenal signing Mana Iwabuchi against Team GB after she had scored the leveller against Canada in their opening game was a strange one. Reinstated to the starting line-up to play Chile, the forward provided the assist for Mina Tanaka’s second-half winner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for our Tokyo 2020 briefing with all the news, views and previews for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\">  <iframe id=\"tokyo-2020-daily-briefing\" name=\"tokyo-2020-daily-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/tokyo-2020-daily-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--tokyo-2020-daily-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for our Tokyo 2020 briefing with all the news, views and previews for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Netherlands v USA (Yokohama)</strong></h2> <p>There is no argument, this rematch of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/07/womens-world-cup-final-report-usa-netherlands\">the 2019 World Cup final</a> is the tastiest tie of the round. Sweden’s stunning 3-0 defeat of the US has cast a shadow over the USA campaign and it raised the spectre of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/usa-lose-womens-football-sweden-olympic-quarter-finals-penalty-kicks\">2016 quarter-final elimination</a> to Sweden. USA are not infallible. The decision to scale things back against Australia, playing to avoid defeat, rather than the blazing swagger that is so synonymous with the USWNT, has been widely questioned. That said, they escaped into the knockout stage, having finished second in their group. </p> <p>USA know they can score against the Netherlands, who have conceded eight goals in their three games despite topping Group F. However, even if you discount the 10 goals the Dutch side put past Olympic newcomers Zambia, they have still scored more than any other team in the tournament (11) with the Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema firing herself into the record books with eight goals, the most scored by a female player in a single Games with matches still to play.

The Canadians conceded a goal a game in Group E, with 84th and 85th minute goals conceded to Japan and Team GB respectively, denying them victory in both matches. Sharpen that focus at the close and Bev Priestman’s team have a good chance of progressing past their South American opponents, ranked one place above them in the Fifa world rankings. Priestman made six changes to the team that beat Chile for Canada’s final group game against Team GB, having already secured passage to the knockout stage. She rested the world’s international record goalscorer, Christine Sinclair, entirely and made two half-time substitutions all with an eye on their next game and the tight turnaround. Brazil can be buoyed by the fact that they twice came from behind against the Netherlands and took the lead before the game finished 3-3 in their toughest test to date.</p>"
